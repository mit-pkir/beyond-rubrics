[**MIT Playful Journey Lab**](http://playful.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"}: The MIT Playful Journey Lab, made up of researchers and designers with a passion for playful assessment and learning, is embarking on a journey to develop emerging technologies as well as non-digital tools to better understand, design, and use innovative approaches that will prepare individuals to participate in 21st century economies. The lab is founded on the belief that these technologies and approaches, supported by research-backed playful learning and assessment practices, are an important tool for empowering learners, and are necessary for designing a lifelong and lifewide education system that prepares individuals to learn throughout their lives — across school, work and interest-driven contexts.

[**MakerEd**](http://www.makered.org){:target="_blank"}: The mission of Maker Ed is to harness the potential of making to transform teaching and learning. To achieve this, the organization provides training, support, and resources to individuals, institutions and communities who are integrating maker education into their learning environments. With more than 5 years of work in the relatively young field of maker education, Maker Ed aggregates and shares examples of making in action in order to validate, elevate, and amplify work on the ground, representing work across the country in both formal and informal educational settings, in rural and urban communities alike, and at three different levels: the field and movement, pedagogy and practice, and of learner outcomes.
