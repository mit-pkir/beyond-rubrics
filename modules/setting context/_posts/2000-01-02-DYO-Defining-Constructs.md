# Design Your Own: Defining Constructs

**Activity Goals:**
  - *Review what different frameworks say about a construct you value.*
  - *Collaboratively define a construct you want to assess in your makerspace or classroom.*

Many educators are drawn to making as a pedagogy because it allows students to develop many of the skills necessary to thrive in our rapidly changing world. You might already have a list of skills and mindsets you are trying to build in your program written up as a set of makerspace values, in your district’s portrait of a graduate, or in other sets of competencies. If you haven’t already, you can explore some of the resources linked to in the first section of this guide to help you articulate your maker program or classroom’s values and goals.

In this activity, you’ll think more deeply about just one of the **constructs** (maker skill or disposition) you hope to support your students to develop. The clearer your understanding of a construct, the better you’ll be able to identify growth in students and support to students towards those goals.

Here is an example of what your whiteboard will look like after this step:

## **Before You Begin**

- Collect The Following Materials
    - Pen and paper
    - White board, flipchart, or shared virtual collaboration space
    - Printed versions of outside frameworks (optional)
    - Your maker program values (optional)
    - Your school/district’s Graduate Profile or Profile of a Learner (optional, sample included)
- Assign Roles
    - *Facilitator*: Will guide participants through the steps in the protocol.
    - *Time-keeper*: Will keep time during *Brainstorm* and help Facilitator stay on track during Cluster, Name, and Resolve portions.
    - *Note-taker*: Will scribe on whiteboard or virtual collaboration space during Brainstorm share out, Cluster, and Naming. Start by
- Select an External Framework. *Each participant should select one of the external frameworks to explore during the brainstorming section.*

    - *Note: You may choose to include any SEL or future ready skills frameworks used by your school or district in addition or instead of the included frameworks.*

Choose which construct your group will focus on. We recommend using **Collaboration** or **Problem Solving** for this exercise. On the top of your white board, the scribe should write the following Focus Question:

**What does it look like to demonstrate [CONSTRUCT]?**

***

## Warm-up

Go around the circle and share a time that you have used the construct. What were you working on? What did it look like to use the construct?

***

## Brainstorm

You will now individually brainstorm answers to the Focus Question. You will draw ideas from three different sources: [1] Your own values as an educator and vision of student success, [2] Your school or district’s values and competencies, and [3] Outside frameworks and research.

1. *Individual Brainstorming Part 1* (5 min): Review your selected external framework and your district or school values and competencies. Brainstorm a list of answers to the focus question based on these frameworks. Each answer should be a short, single sentence. **Try to have 5+ ideas.**
2. *Individual Brainstorming Part 2* (5 min): Now add answers to your list based on your own values and vision of student success. Each idea should still be a short, single sentence that answers the focus question. **Try to come up with at least 5 more ideas.**
3. *Select your best ideas* (5 min): Again, individually, review all of the answers on your list. Select the ones that are the clearest, and most connect to your values, district values, or outside frameworks. Rephrase these ideas into clear, 3-10 word sentences or phrases.
4. *Share the ideas.* Go around the circle, with each person sharing one of their ideas. Record each idea in a list on the left side of your whiteboard. Number each item for easy identification. Continue until all ideas have been shared and recorded.

#### Tips

  - We have included a [sample portrait of a learner](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QD6iWzqKG_sRaDo5aIr0aX5AeQd45fmO){:target="_blank"} as an example of district level values. You may substitute a similar framework from your school or district if it is available.

  - Example: if the chosen construct was Agency, one of your answers might be “Setting your own goals.” or “Seeking out relevant resources to solve a problem.”

  - The number of ideas selected by each person may vary, but aim to have no more than 20 items across your entire group. For example, if you have 4 people, aim for ~4-6 ideas per person.

***

## Cluster

In this step you will find the overlaps and similarities between the different ideas generated.

1. Give the first item a symbol (✩, △, ≡, ♯, ○, etc.), write it next to it’s number.
2. Ask if the 2nd item is the same or similar to the first. If it is, draw the same symbol. If not, write a different symbol beside it.
3. Continue through the list, categorizing each with a symbol. Some items may have more than one symbol.
4. Continue until all items have a symbol.

***

## Name

The names for each cluster should provide different answers to the focus question, and provide different ways a student might demonstrate the selected construct, or indicators of the construct. They should be specific, observable, and represent the ideas from your brainstormed list.

1. Draw all of your symbols in a large column to the right of your list.
2. Read through all of the list items marked with the first symbol. What should that group be named? Aim to have a short, single sentence that answers the focus question. To come up with a name, the facilitator might ask the following questions:
    - What one sentence or phrase will be most descriptive of all ideas in this cluster?
    - What title will be inclusive of all insights represented by the ideas?
    - What is our insight, or answer to the focus question being pointed to by the ideas in the cluster?

    After you have come up with a name, be sure you have consensus or agreement from the group. If not, continue to rework the name of the cluster. If you have consensus, write the name next to the symbol. Continue until all clusters have a name.

***

## Resolve

Review and reflect on your work.

1. Read through all of the named groups out loud. Together, it should represent a shared understanding of the construct, with individual things you might see a student do to demonstrate the selected construct.
2. Discuss the results:
    - What on the list are you most excited about or intrigued by? Are you uneasy or uncomfortable about anything on the list?
    - What new insights do you have about the selected construct? Has anything been left out?
3. Determine next steps. See suggestions below.

***

## Next Steps

There are a number of next steps you might take to continue to build your team's shared understanding of the construct and the individual indicators.

- Draw snapshots, or frames from a comic strip of what it would look like if a student was demonstrating one of the items on your list. Compare the drawings with your colleagues to see similarities and differences in your understanding.
- Share your results with students. Ask them to draw a picture of what it might look like if they were doing one of the things on your final list. Ask them what on the list excites them or makes them uneasy. Ask them if anything is missing.
- Share your results with other stakeholders (your principal, parents, or others) to get feedback.

You’ll also want to set aside time to come to consensus on each of the skills or mindsets you want to assess. We recommend starting with a small set (2-3) to begin, and add more as you get more comfortable with noticing and assessing skills in your makerspace or classroom.
