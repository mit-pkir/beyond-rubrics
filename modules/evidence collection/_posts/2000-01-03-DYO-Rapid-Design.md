# Design Your Own: Rapid Design
**Guiding Questions:**
 - How can we elicit evidence?
 - How can we collect evidence?

**Activity Duration:** 1-1.5 hour

All of the data collection tools in the Beyond Rubrics Toolkit are designed using the principles discussed in Section 0, here is a refresher:
1. **Assessment of making should be construct driven.** The skills, mindsets, and dispositions need to be clearly articulated, discussed, and negotiated by members of the learning community. Some of the tools are more appropriate for certain types of constructs. Some are designed to capture evidence around very particular constructs, such as Stuck Station which is designed to capture evidence of Troubleshooting.
2. **Assessment in making should be seamlessly woven into the culture of the classroom and learning environments.** The assessment should be ongoing, engaging, and continuous so the line between learning and assessment is blurred. Many of the tools will take practice to use, and will take time to become truly part of a classroom’s culture and routines.
3. **Assessment in making should be evidence-centered.** The tools are designed to generate visible, tangible, and varied forms of evidence that can be linked back to the underlying constructs.
4. **Assessment in making should involve students as active participants.** When using the data collection tools, students will receive evidence that was noticed by others but also act as data collectors, noticing things about their own practice but also that of their peers.
In this activity you will have the opportunity to try out the Beyond Rubrics design principles to rapidly design a maker activity and data collection instrument with colleagues. The designs will be based on a set of Rapid Design cards which will include a Construct, Context, and Secret Ingredient. These prompts will help to get you out of the specific context of your class, and focus on designing with the principles in mind, but feel free to swap out the Constructs to one you focus on in your class.

### Before you begin
collect the following materials:
  - Writing & drawing tools
  - Flipchart paper or white board
  - [Rapid Design cards](https://playfulmit.github.io/beyond-rubrics/modules/evidence collection/resources/RapidDesignCards.pdf){:target="_blank"}, printed

- Assign Roles:
  - *Facilitator:* Will guide participants through the steps in the process.
  - *Time-keeper:* Will keep track of time for each step in the process.

### Facilitation Guide
1. Warm-up *(10 min)*: Go around the circle and share: What is one learning experience from your childhood, in or out of school, that you remember fondly? What was it about the experience that made it stick with you?
2. Draw one card from each of the three decks: Construct, Context, Secret Ingredient.
3. Rapid Design *(30 min)*. Work together to create a prototype of a maker activity and data collection tool. Document your design onto a poster that includes:
  - **Your definition of the construct or skill. How did you define the construct?
  - **The maker activity or task**. What are you asking the students to do to demonstrate the construct?
  - **Example of good evidence of learning**. What will you see that shows you the students are demonstrating the construct or school?
  - **A tool or mechanism for collecting evidence**. How will you collect visible, tangible evidence?
4. Gallery Walk (10 min): If multiple teams were designing at the same time, take a few minutes to look at all of the prototypes that were designed. What do you notice? What do you wonder?
5. Discuss (10 min):
  - What in the designs stands out to you?
  - What was easy about this design process? What was hard?
  - What were characteristics of the activity you designed that allowed for students to demonstrate evidence of your selected construct?
  - How did you decide what good evidence of learning for your construct looked like? What is good evidence?
  - What are changes you could make to the activities you facilitate to allow students to show evidence of learning? How will you capture that evidence?

*The card mechanic was inspired by the co-design practices of the [IDeATe Network at Carnegie Mellon University](https://ideate.cmu.edu/).*

### Next Steps
Pick one of the activities or lessons you are planning to facilitate in the next month. What is one tool you could remix or modify from the Beyond Rubrics Toolkit or your designs today that you could implement in your makerspace or classroom?

**Tool Remix and Modification Examples**
Explore the Teacher Guides for each tool included in the toolkit for suggested remixes or modifications that have been tried in other classrooms. The modifications vary from minor modifications to full redesign of tools:

|-------------------------------|-----|
![](https://playfulmit.github.io/beyond-rubrics/img/remix-1.png) | **Incorporate into an existing protocol.** Include definitions of constructs and and documentation tools into a “Lab Notebook” or “Design Journal” you already use to support project based work.
![](https://playfulmit.github.io/beyond-rubrics/img/remix-2.png) | **Small remix.** Add sentence stems to Sparkle Sleuth slips based on your classroom’s understanding of a competency to help teachers and students better identify moments.
![](https://playfulmit.github.io/beyond-rubrics/img/remix-3.png) | **Tool redesign.** Maker Moments allows participants to quickly document an instance of a construct, but doesn’t collect any qualitative information. This “Maker Punch Card” takes the mechanic from Maker Moments but adds the opportunity to capture qualitative information for some instances.
