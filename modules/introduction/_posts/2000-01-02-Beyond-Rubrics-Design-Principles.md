# Beyond Rubrics Design Principles

**Key Questions:**
  - *What does good assessment look like?*

**Activity Duration:** 1 hour

We often start workshops or conference presentations by giving participants the opportunity to reflect on the question “What is Assessment?” It can be a term loaded with emotions and anxiety. In our work, we see assessment as ongoing, engaging, continuous, and seamlessly woven into a culture of learning. Good assessment processes make the learning process visible to educators and learners so that they may give better feedback, set ambitious learning goals, and communicate their learning with others.
This activity will introduce you to the design principles that we used in the creation of the Beyond Rubrics tool kit, and that you might use to adapt, remix, or design your own.

## Before You Begin:
### Collect the following materials:
- A journal or paper and pen to capture reflections.
- Printed or digital copies of the design principles, one set per participant.

### Assign roles:
- *Facilitator:* Will guide participants through the steps in the process.
- *Time-keeper:* Will keep track of time for each step in the process.

## Exploring the Design Principles
### Warm-up (10 min)
1. Individually, take a moment to reflect on the following questions:
  - What is assessment?
  - What did assessment mean to you as a K-12 student?
2. Share your reflections in the group.

### Assessment Design Principles Jigsaw
1. Watch the following video as a group:

2. If working with a larger group, form small groups of 4 people each. Each participation should take one of the design principles.
3. Explore your design principle (5-10 min). Individually, read about your chosen design principle. As you read, consider the following questions:
  - What is the principle?
  - What reaction do you have to the principle?
  - How does it relate to your current assessment practices? How is it different?
4. Share about your design principle (10 min). Regroup with colleagues. Go around the circle and share about the individual design principles. Continue around the circle until everyone has shared.
5. Discuss with colleagues (20 min):
  - What stood out to you in the principles and examples provided?
  - What resonated with your own views on assessment? What was challenging?
  - As a whole, how do these principles relate to your current assessment practice? (You may choose to rank the principles from the ones you do most consistently to the least.
6. Closing Reflection (10 min), As a full group, go around the circle and share a Monday and Someday for these design principles:
  - Monday: What is one thing you could try tomorrow (or on Monday) to try this principle in your classroom, school, or learning community.
  - Someday: What would it look like to fully design your classroom, school, or learning community using this design principle.

## Next Steps
Make a plan to implement your “Monday” from the closing reflection!
