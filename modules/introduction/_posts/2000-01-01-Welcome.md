# Welcome to Designing for Documentation & Assessment

While there are many benefits of making and makerspaces, one of the greatest challenges of implementing making in K–12 schools is the question of how to assess collaborative, cross-disciplinary, and iterative making practices and outcomes. Many existing assessment tools for maker-centered classrooms focus on the final project or a portfolio. The Beyond Rubrics Toolkit has embedded tools to capture evidence of the process of making. The Beyond Rubrics toolkit is our first attempt at capturing qualitative and quantitative evidence during the process of making.
On this site, you’ll find a series of activities to introduce the tools we have developed in each of the toolkit sections, with tips on implementing them yourself. For each section of this guide you will find two activities to help you implement, adapt, and remix the Beyond Rubrics Toolkit:
- **Try the Toolkit**: These activities will help you implement and reflect on the existing tools in the Beyond Rubrics Toolkit.
- **Design Your Own**: These activities will help you use the Beyond Rubrics design principles to adapt and remix the tools for your own context.

If you are just getting started on your maker education journey, there are a number of great resources from our friends and partners for thinking more deeply about the goals and practices in your community.
- MakerEd’s website features a wide range of curated resources for schools and institutions on their [Getting Started](https://makered.org/resources/getting-started/){:target="_blank"} page, you might start by exploring the why and how with their [Visioning](https://makered.org/resources/getting-started/){:target="_blank"} tool.
- Informal education institutions are encouraged to check out the [Making & Learning](http://p2pu.github.io/makingandlearning/){:target="_blank"} open online course from IMLS & the Children’s Museum of Pittsburgh.
