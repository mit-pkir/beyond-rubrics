# Welcome to Designing for Documentation & Assessment

**INTRO VIDEO HERE**

While there are many benefits of making and makerspaces, one of the greatest challenges of implementing making in K–12 schools is the question of how to assess collaborative, cross-disciplinary, and iterative making practices and outcomes. Many existing assessment tools for maker-centered classrooms focus on the final project or a portfolio. The Beyond Rubrics toolkit is our first attempt at capturing qualitative and quantitative evidence during the process of making.
Beyond Rubrics toolkit was created by the MIT Playful Journey Lab and Maker Ed, in collaboration with educators at [Community Public Charter School](https://www.k12albemarle.org/school/cpcs/Pages/default.aspx){:target="_blank"} in Charlottesville, Virginia and [Corte Madera School](http://cms.pvsd.net/){:target="_blank"} in Portola Valley, California. To download all of these customizable tools, as well as teachers guides for each tool visit the [Beyond Rubrics Toolkit site](www.makered.org/beyondrubrics){:target="_blank"}.

###How to use this guide
In this guide, you’ll find a series of activities to introduce the tools we have developed in each of the toolkit sections, with tips on implementing them yourself. For each section of this guide you will find two activities to help you implement, adapt, and remix the Beyond Rubrics Toolkit:
  - **Try the Toolkit**: These activities will help you implement and reflect on the existing tools in the Beyond Rubrics Toolkit.
  - **Design Your Own**: These activities will help you use the Beyond Rubrics design principles to adapt and remix the tools for your own context.

The activities come from conference sessions and workshops we have led with educators to introduce them to our work. Each activity will take 1-2 hours to complete, and can be done with a small group of 3-5 educators in your program or department, or may be facilitated with a larger group of colleagues.
It may be helpful to have a particular project or unit into which you can incorporate the Beyond Rubrics tools. *For instance, maybe you’re a 9th grade physics teacher and do a successful balloon launch project each year. This year, consider going through this learning pathway with colleagues and use it as an opportunity to enhance your documentation and assessment practices.*
There are many sequences you might choose to work through the activities in this guide, but two paths we recommend:

**Implementing the Beyond Rubrics Toolkit**
This path will get up and running with the Beyond Rubrics toolkit. You’ll have the opportunity to try out tools from each of the sections of the tool kit with colleagues in preparation for implementing the tools with students. The activities could be done once per week for a month to allow for time to reflect and implement with students, or spend a half day working through all four for a deep dive into the tools.
*For the Physics teacher implementing the balloon launch project, this might mean you already have clear maker mindsets and you want to document and assess, but want to collect better evidence of these mindsets and skills along the way.*

2. Try the Toolkit: Superpower Hour
3. Try the Toolkit: Design a Monument
4. Meaning Making: Learning From Student Work Protocol

**Designing for Documentation and Assessment**
This path is for educators who are interested in taking a deeper dive into designing documentation and assessment systems in their makerspace or classroom. The additional “Design Your Own” activities give you the opportunity to put the Beyond Rubrics Design Principles into practice. You’ll spend time defining your own constructs, and participate in a rapid design session to support remixing or redesigning evidence collection tools. The activities should be done over the course of several weeks (or a full semester) so that you have the opportunity to engage in design and implementation between sessions.
*For the Physics teacher implementing the balloon launch project, you may already have clear assessment practices for the content goals but you are interested in expanding your learning goals to include mindsets and skills such as collaboration or troubleshooting.*

5. Design Your Own: Activity & Data Collection Tool Rapid Design
6. Meaning Making: Learning From Student Work Protocol

While this guide will help you get up and running with the Beyond Rubrics tools and principles, it is not a comprehensive introduction to making as pedagogy, assessment and Evidence Centered Design, or as comprehensive as what we hope to have one day after we’ve learned more and had a more sustained co-design process with a classroom. We encourage you to explore these additional resources for more ideas.

### Additional Resources:
If you are just getting started on your maker education journey, there are a number of great resources from our friends and partners for thinking more deeply about the goals and practices in your community.
- MakerEd’s website features a wide range of curated resources for schools and institutions on their [Getting Started](https://makered.org/resources/getting-started/){:target="_blank"} page, you might start by exploring the why and how with their [Visioning](https://makered.org/resources/getting-started/){:target="_blank"} tool.
- Informal education institutions are encouraged to check out the [Making & Learning](http://p2pu.github.io/makingandlearning/){:target="_blank"} open online course from IMLS & the Children’s Museum of Pittsburgh.
- Many of the principles in this guide are based on those of Evidence Centered Design, which you can read more about in this [Introduction to Evidence Centered Design](https://circlcenter.org/evidence-centered-design/){:target="_blank"} from the Center for Innovative Research in Cyberlearning.
