## Going Beyond Rubrics in maker-centered classrooms & makerspaces.

While there are many benefits of making and makerspaces, one of the greatest challenges of implementing making in Kâ€“12 schools is the question of how to assess collaborative, cross-disciplinary, and iterative making practices and outcomes for students. Many existing assessment tools for maker-centered classrooms focus on the final project or a portfolio. The Beyond Rubrics toolkit was released by the [MIT Playful Journey Lab](https://playful.mit.edu/) & [Maker Ed](https://makered.org/) as a first attempt at capturing qualitative and quantitative evidence during the process of making.

This guide will introduce educators to the tools and design principles in the Beyond Rubrics toolkit, to open up our design process and help you use the tools in your own learning community. The activities in the guide were designed to support small groups of educators in a community of practice to think more deeply about learning, documentation, and assessment in their classrooms,  makerspaces, or out-of-school time programs.

We look forward to seeing how you remix, adapt, and design new ways to better capture the learning in your classroom or program!
