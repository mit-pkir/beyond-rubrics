## Going Beyond Rubrics in maker-centered classrooms & makerspaces.

This guide will introduce educators to the tools and design principles in the [Beyond Rubrics toolkit](http://www.makered.org/beyondrubrics/). While there are many benefits of making and makerspaces, one of the greatest challenges of implementing making in Kâ€“12 schools is the question of how to assess collaborative, cross-disciplinary, and iterative making practices and outcomes. Many existing assessment tools for maker-centered classrooms focus on the final project or a portfolio. The toolkit was released by the [MIT Playful Journey Lab](http://playful.mit.edu/) & [MakerEd](http://www.makered.org/) as a first attempt at capturing qualitative and quantitative evidence during the process of making.

We look forward to seeing how you remix, adapt, and design new ways to better capture the learning in your classroom or program!
